## Wireframes
### Homepage
![homepage](ux-design/homepage.png)

Purpose of the Screen: 
* This is the first screen a user will find when they access the Ranked website.
We want to present the most popular posts or forums of any miscellaneous game first (where the entire screen is vertical scrollable) and also have a scrolling list (horizontal) of games right underneath the header to increase engagement from the user. If they can’t find what they are looking for while scrolling they can either click/tap on the game name/icon or tag or game name, or even search for a keyword in the keyword button in the top. 
* They can also access the Login, About Us, and Contact Us page from the hamburger menu.

### Megathread Page

Purpose of the Screen:
* This is the page that will appear after the user has selected a game from the scrolling game header on the Homepage.
* This page highlights one specific game and showcases megathreads related to that game.
* The “Game Name” tiles will have the game title written in text (as opposed to their image representation on the Homepage, this is for legibility and space).

### Subthread Page
