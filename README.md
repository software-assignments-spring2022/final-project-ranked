## Product Vision Statement
Ranked is a game forum site that provides developers with instant access to feedback on game updates, balance changes, and more, along with creating a community that players can refer to when looking for advice, ideas, or even whether or not the game is worth it. Players can create threads on any aspect of a game and get answers from other verified players. This creates a community for the players, all the while building trust with our platform (something near impossible in the gaming space).

### MVP
- Users are able to create an account based on their email address and a unique username 
- Users can search for megathreads (games) and view current posts and comments related to each
- Verified users can post, comment, and vote on posts (they also select tags to categorize the post)

### Necessary Features for Each Theme
- User account creation 
- User find megathreads
- User posting, commenting, and voting

### Themes
- As a User, I want to be able to ask general questions related to a game, so that I can get answers.
  - Theme name: **General Questions**
  - Example Posts: What power level should you be for the last boss? What’s a good lineup for Raze on Ascent? How does the new competitive system work on Brawl Stars?
  - User in-game verification is **“Nice-to-Have”**
- As a User, I want to post my gameplay and get reviews, so that Ranked is a resource that helps me improve competitively
  - Theme name: **Improvement**
  - Example Posts: Can a pro player review my gameplay and explain what I did wrong? As a top 500 Tracer I’m hosting an AMA at 5:00 pm, I want to help!
  - User in-game verification is **“Necessary”**
- As a User, I want to debate on the utility of aspects of a game, so that Ranked is a community I can learn more about my favorite game from
  - Theme name: **Meta Discussion**
  - Example Posts: Is Aegis Amulet or the Beads a better choice as Poseidon on Conquest? Is the ak47 or mac10 a better choice for Warzone? Why do so many people use the crossbow in Rust?
  - User in-game verification is **“Nice-to-Have”**

### Future Features
- Verified users can act as moderators for specific megathreads if they are a part of the group that created it and/or we approve them
- Verified users can participate in daily and/or monthly polls on how much they like whichever game their current megathread is
- Game developers and studios can be verified/approved with us then create their own megathread pertaining to their games, however they do not moderate it

## Brief History and Contributions
The idea for Ranked started with Chris, but none of the progress made would’ve been possible without India, Phillip, Sid, Jason, and Yoshiaki, so all credit goes to them. Originally, the idea was for a video game social media site where you could post clips of your gameplay. However it became obvious the utility of that is more limited than an open forum and thus Ranked was born. If you’d like to contribute to our project, please reference the [Contributions Document](https://github.com/software-assignments-spring2022/final-project-ranked/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), then message any of us on Github. We’ll be happy to get in touch with you!
